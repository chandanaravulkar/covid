      <h2>COVID-19</h2>
    <P>Late in 2019, scientists started monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.
         They first identified the virus in Wuhan, China.
        The virus spread rapidly around the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic in March 2020.</P>

                     where deaths and disability are directly linked to COVID-19.
                      Alongside the atrocious death toll, an as yet untold number of
                       people are living with the lasting aftermath of a severe acute 
                       respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection—for some,

                to measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19. It includes,
                 among many others, those who delay presenting to healthcare facilities
                  for fear of COVID-19 infection; those with progressive diseases whose 
                  appointments are rescheduled; and those who miss routine screening.

        • Current evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in
         close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range).
          A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus
           are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.
           People may also become infected by touching surfaces that have been contaminated by the virus when touching their eyes, nose or mouth without cleaning their hands.

Further research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food.
         The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar
          to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.

  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <img src="/images/avoidcrowd.jpeg" alt="">
    <strong>Avoid Large Gatherings</strong>
    <p>Since close person-to-person contact appears to be the main source of transmission, social distancing remains a key way to mitigate spread.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box">
    <img src="/images/avoidcontact.jpeg" alt="">
    <strong>Avoid Contact With Sick People</strong>
    <p>A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus.</p>

    <h3>Are you tested Covid Positive?</h3>
    <p>Staying at home will help to control the spread of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to your friends, relatives and your wider community.<br> In particular, staying at home will help prevent spread to the most vulnerable people in our communities, who are at risk for severe illness.<br>
    If you understand how coronavirus disease spreads, this will help you to understand how to prevent spreading the infection to others.<br> Stay a few meters away from other people, wash your hands frequently and cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.<br>Most people who get sick with coronavirus disease will have only a mild illness and should recover at home. You may continue to experience the typical symptoms which include a fever, cough and mild shortness of breath. <br> Most people with mild illness will start feeling better within a week of first symptoms. Have your healthcare provider’s contact information on hand for emergencies – this could be your GP or your nearest local clinic/ hospital.</p>
